# Toolkit for Prime Locations (AABPL)
(c) Gabriel M. Ahlfeldt, Thilo N. H. Albers, Kristian Behrens
Version 1.0.0, 2025-01

## General description

This toolkit complements Ahlfeldt, Albers, Behrens (2024), who develop a delineation algorithm for ultra-dense employment clusters within cities, which is applied to US MSAs and a sample of Global Cities. 

This toolkit consists of the following main components:
- shapefiles of delineated prime locations for 381 US MSAs (all except Puerto Rico) and 125 Global cities
- data sets that provide key statistics on these prime locations and summarize the geography of prime locations by city
- shapefiles for micro-geographic grids that include employment by sector (US MSAs) as well as predicted employment and other measures of economic activity (Global Cities)
- An interactive toolkit that allows for a convenient visual impression of delineated prime locations and data download by city
- A Python version of our delineation algorithm which is flexibly applicable to spatial point pattern data

This toolkit is a complement and not a substitute for the replication directory. For reproduction of the results reported in the article, we refer to the official **replication directory** which is currently under construction.

When using the toolkit in your work, **please cite Ahlfeldt, Albers, Behrens (2024): Prime locations, American Economic Review: Insights, forthcoming.**

## Interactive toolkit

As a part of this toolkit, we provide an [interactive web tool](https://sites.google.com/view/ahlfeldt/toolkits-and-webtools/prime-locations) that conveniently presents our delineated prime locations against the background of the spatial distribution of economic activity for 381 US MSAs and 125 Global Cities.

## Algorithm

The **Python package** for the delineation of spatial clusters akin to prime locations is published in this **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ahlfeldt/AABPL-toolkit-python)**. It uses arbitrary spatial point patterns as input and returns a gridded version of the data along with polygons of the delineated spatial clusters as outputs. 

## Data

All data outputs are available from the folders below. Outputs for individual cities can be conveniently downloaded using our [interactive web tool](https://sites.google.com/view/ahlfeldt/toolkits-and-webtools/prime-locations). To download the content as a whole, the most convenient way is to access the directory via [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
